# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Purpose

Go CLI tool that measures latency to a Minecraft Java Edition server using the native handshake -> status -> ping/pong sequence. It supports SRV lookup, explicit IPv4 or IPv6 forcing, and private-address filtering.

## Commands

```bash
# Build
go build -v ./...

# Show flags
go run . -help

# Show embedded build version
go run . -version

# Run
./minecraft-ping -server mc.example.com \
  [-port 25565] \
  [-timeout 5s] \
  [-allow-private] \
  [-format text|json] \
  [-4|-6]

# Unit tests
go test -v ./...

# Fuzz tests (run locally; CI runs them from the unit-test workflow)
go test ./... -run=^$ -fuzz=FuzzReadVarIntFromBytes -fuzztime=30s
go test ./... -run=^$ -fuzz=FuzzReadStringFromBytes -fuzztime=30s
go test ./... -run=^$ -fuzz=FuzzReadPacket -fuzztime=30s

# Container-backed staging smoke
scripts/staging_smoke.sh
```

## Architecture

- `minecraft-ping.go` — program entry point
- `cli.go` — CLI parsing, help/version handling, output rendering, and process exit behavior
- `version.go` — build-time version string used by `-version`
- `client.go` — request validation, SRV handling, address resolution, dialing, and ping execution
- `endpoint.go` — endpoint normalization plus address-family and host validation
- `address.go` — non-public address detection and family-aware dial candidate ordering
- `protocol.go` — packet serialization and parsing for handshake, status, and ping/pong
- `minecraft-ping_test.go` — end-to-end protocol, resolution, and dialing tests with fakes
- `minecraft_ping_cli_test.go` — CLI behavior tests for help, version, output, and exit paths
- `ping_fuzz_test.go` — fuzz targets for parser robustness

## CLI Behavior

- Default output is human-readable text: `Ping time is N ms`
- `-format=json` emits `{"server":"...","latency_ms":N}`
- `-4` forces IPv4 resolution and dialing
- `-6` forces IPv6 resolution and dialing
- `-version` prints the embedded build version and exits
- Private and loopback targets are rejected unless `-allow-private` is set

## CI

`CI` (`.github/workflows/go.yml`) runs:

- `govulncheck`
- `gosec`
- `go build`
- native `go test` coverage on Linux, macOS, and Windows for `amd64` and `arm64`
- a GoReleaser snapshot build that exercises release archives and Linux packages before tagging
- Linux package install smoke tests on Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Alpine for `amd64` and `arm64`
- a container-backed dual-stack smoke test via `scripts/staging_smoke.sh`
- diff-scoped mutation testing on pull requests

The staging smoke runs one IPv4 ping (`-4`) and one IPv6 ping (`-6`) against the same Minecraft container. The IPv6 path is exposed through a local `::1` relay to avoid Docker runtime differences in direct IPv6 loopback publishing.

`Release` (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) uses GoReleaser to build signed archives for macOS, Linux, and Windows, build signed Linux `.deb`, `.rpm`, and `.apk` packages, inject the release version for `-version`, and publish the release assets on GitHub.

## Notes

- Packet IDs are named constants in `protocol.go`; preserve that style.
- Keep the transport path simple: validation -> SRV resolution -> family-aware resolution -> dial -> protocol exchange.
- Prefer tests that exercise real CLI behavior and fake network boundaries over broad mocking of internal implementation details.
